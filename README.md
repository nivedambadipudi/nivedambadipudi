Hello !!! I am Nived. I started coding when I was in my early teenage and have been coding through my high school. I enjoy coding as part of my projects playing with drones, or helping with data processing for research projects. I am fascinated with working on projects that have a hardware component or a lab experiment and use software to enhance/enrich the results from the experimentation.
